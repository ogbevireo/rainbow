Rainbow Text Exercise

I've provided you with an <h1> element which contains 7 individual spans (each holding a single letter). 

    Please write some JavaScript to make them rainbow-colored! 

    In app.js you'll find an array of color names called colors.  It looks like: ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet'].

    Your task is to select all spans, iterate over them, and assign them each one of the colors from the colors array.  The first span should be red, the second should be orange, etc.   Your result should look like this:

ClassList Practice

In index.html, you'll find 6 <li> elements, two of which have the 'highlight' class applied to them. 

    Please use JavaScript and the classList property to invert which elements have the highlight class. 

    Basically iterate over all the <li> elements and toggle the class of 'highlight' on each one.   Your end result should look like this:

Please don't touch the markup in index.html! Do this all via JavaScript!
